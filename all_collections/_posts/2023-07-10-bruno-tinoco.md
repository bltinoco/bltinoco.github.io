# Where Everything Starts

## Origin

I was born and raised in Brazil, specifically in the city of Suzano, Sao Paulo in April 1995. Since I was a little boy, my passion for science, technology and how things worked dictated my learning journey. My aptitude and a strong liking for technology, exact sciences, and chemistry made me decide to study Chemical Engineering.

## Achievement of my Bachelor's Degree

My studies in the area of chemical engineering started in 2018, at [Instituto Maua de Tecnologia](https://maua.br). The course lasted 6 years with many challenges, acquired knowledge and friendships conquered. Even having to travel for an hour and a half every day to come and go, I earned this bachelor's degree that I am very proud of.

## From Brazil to Canda

During my Chemical Engineering graduation, I met a girl, Larissa, that today is my wife, who always supported me. Together we decided to come to Canada so I could study Power Engineering, at [SAIT](https://www.sait.ca) and, perhaps, start a new journey in this country. I cannot fail to mention the support of my parents, trusting me to quit my old job in a laboratory and be part of their business, making it possible to come to Canada.

## Achievements already acquired in Canada

With a lot of dedication, my wife's support and help from friends and instructors at the college, I am already certified as a 4th Class Power Engineer. Now I'm in my last college year and I am looking to pass all 3rd class exams and find a job here in Canada. Details of my education can be found on my [CV](https://bltinoco.github.io/posts/curriculum-vitae/).

# Future Achievements

This year I will finish my course at SAIT, obtaining a diploma in energy engineering, opening the opportunity to pursue a career here in Canada. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I'm going to follow each step at once.
