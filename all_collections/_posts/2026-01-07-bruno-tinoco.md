# Where Everything Starts

## Origin

I was born and raised in Brazil, specifically in the city of Suzano, Sao Paulo in April 1995. Since I was a little boy, my passion for science, technology and how things worked dictated my learning journey. My aptitude and a strong liking for technology, exact sciences, and chemistry made me decide to study Chemical Engineering.

## Achievement of my Bachelor's Degree

My studies in the area of chemical engineering started in 2018, at [Instituto Maua de Tecnologia](https://maua.br). The course lasted 6 years with many challenges, acquired knowledge and friendships conquered. Even having to travel for an hour and a half every day to come and go, I earned this bachelor's degree that I am very proud of.

## From Brazil to Canda

During my Chemical Engineering graduation, I met a girl, Larissa, that today is my wife, who always supported me. Together we decided to come to Canada so I could study Power Engineering, at [SAIT](https://www.sait.ca) and, perhaps, start a new journey in this country. I cannot fail to mention the support of my parents, trusting me to quit my old job in a laboratory and be part of their business, making it possible to come to Canada.

## Achievements already acquired in Canada

With a lot of dedication, my wife's support and help from friends and instructors at the college, I am already certified as a 4th Class Power Engineer.

# Future Achievements

My academic journey has equipped me with a multifaceted skill set. My background in chemical engineering, highlighted by my bachelor’s degree, enables me to approach technical challenges from a unique perspective. 

Along with this, I just completed a Diploma in Power Engineering Technology at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT), which has equipped me with a solid foundation in power engineering principles, operations, and safety protocols. This academic pursuit aligns seamlessly with my desire to make a meaningful impact in power plant operations.

While my professional experience is limited, my education has equipped me with a solid foundation in chemical engineering principles, energy systems, and plant operations.

During my studies, I excelled in coursework related to energy systems, thermodynamics, and heat transfer. I undertook projects that required the application of these concepts to real-world scenarios, such as optimizing energy efficiency in chemical processes and designing heat exchangers for improved performance. My academic achievements reflect my dedication to learning and my ability to analyze complex problems.

What I may lack in practical experience, I make up for with my enthusiasm, adaptability, and determination. I am a quick learner who thrives in dynamic environments and enjoys collaborating with diverse teams.
